Requirements elicitation is a crucial yet time-consuming part of the software development process that often results in vague and unclear information received from potential clients when done in the conventional manner. When done face-to-face, vague information received could lead to the downfall of a project as this process lays the foundation for building a quality system that aligns with a client’s needs. Hence, this project proposes the design and implementation of an AI-driven interviewer that can elicit requirements from a client by conducting dynamic yet systematic natural language interviews. The project utilises a publicly available large language model, Gemini, to interpret client responses and questions using natural language processing to ask contextually aware follow-up questions to clear any vague requirements and gather a more comprehensive coverage of all the necessary requirements. Evaluation is done by simulating real-world client interactions with the AI interviewer, feeding it various requirements for it to classify. Final results show that the AI interviewer is able to streamline the whole process successfully while maintaining the accuracy of requirement elicitation. This project has the potential to assist software developers in communicating more effectively and efficiently with clients in the future.
